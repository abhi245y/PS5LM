# Changelog

Versions follow [semver](https://semver.org). The app's version is set in
`ps5/app/version.hpp` and shown on the dashboard; each release is tagged
`v<version>` and ships `ps5lm-app-v<version>.zip` (see `scripts/release-app.sh`).
v0.1.x are the upstream payload releases by cobanov.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- POWER card: the SoC's power (CPU, GPU and memory together), its history,
  energy used this session and joules per generated token; expanded, min,
  average and max, fan duty and every temperature sensor. The reading is
  `sceKernelGetSocPowerConsumption`'s low 32 bits in milliwatts (22 W idle,
  86 W while the 27B generates), through ps5-exporter.
- USAGE card: GPU and CPU on one chart; expanded, GPU, CPU, memory, storage
  and the models on disk.

### Changed
- USAGE replaces the GPU and CPU tiles; THERMALS shows the hottest sensor.

### Fixed
- Speed and GPU use during a long reply: llama-server's counters move only
  when a request ends, so the live figures come from the slot's token count.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- Pages on L1/R1: Dashboard, Settings and Logs, with tabs in the header.
- Settings page (rail and rows after the kit's Control Room design): load a
  model at launch and which one, the planner's longest context and KV cache
  type, interface sounds; saved to `/data/PS5LM/settings.json`.
- Logs page: `app.log` and `llama.log`, scrollable, with an errors-only filter.
- Model details on Cross over the Model tile: every llama-server argument, the
  plan, cache and preset; Triangle opens the library.
- THERMALS tile (SoC and CPU temperature, fan duty), STORAGE tile (free space
  on /data and USB), and the CPU clock. A title may not read the sensors
  (`0x80020002`), so the app bundles Marice's ps5-exporter (GPL-3.0, pinned
  v0.2.0) and sends it to elfldr when it is not running.
- `scripts/ps5lm-app.sh press <button>`: drive the screens from a PC.

- Chat tools: the browser chat's model can read, write, edit and search files
  (llama-server's built-in tools), confined to `/data/PS5LM/scratch` by
  `patches/0003-tools-root.patch`. Settings has a switch, a size warning
  (default 2 GiB) and a Clear action.
- Images: a vision model's `mmproj` file beside it is loaded with it
  (`--mmproj`), and the planner counts its memory.

- The planner can plan from the first bytes of a GGUF (a range request), the
  base of the model market's fit column.

### Changed
- One MEMORY tile replaces MEMORY and GPU MEMORY (the GPU and CPU share one
  pool); CONTEXT takes in the session counts.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-10

First release of the native app (title PPSA99581), from this fork.

### Added
- Native PS5 app running llama-server on the GPU through ggml-vulkan and RADV,
  with an 11.44 GiB unified device heap.
- Dashboard on the TV (ps5-homebrew-ui): generation speed, GPU busy, CPU use,
  memory pool, GPU memory split, session, context and model tiles.
- Model library with internal storage and USB drive sections; models load
  straight from USB.
- Planner that picks context length and KV cache type for the memory free.
- Sampling presets for Qwen 3.5/3.6/3.8, Gemma 4, gpt-oss, Granite, Nemotron,
  Mistral and Llama.
- Model switching by restarting the app (in-place unload leaks GPU memory).
- `scripts/ps5lm-app.sh` to drive the app from a PC, and the version on the
  dashboard and in the log.

### Fixed
- Unloading during a reply no longer hangs the app: it waits at most 10 s for
  llama-server before restarting.

### Changed
- A plain launch loads no model and opens the library.
